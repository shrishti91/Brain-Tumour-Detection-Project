# BrainTune: Brain Tumor Detection 🧠🔍

BrainTune is a machine learning model developed to detect brain tumors from medical imaging data. With an impressive accuracy of 95% on the dataset provided by Kaggle, BrainTune aims to aid in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes by assisting medical professionals in the detection of brain tumors.

## Description 📝

BrainTune utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data, such as MRI scans, and accurately identify the presence of brain tumors. By automating the detection process, BrainTune reduces the time and effort required for diagnosis, allowing medical professionals to focus on treatment planning and patient care.

## Dataset 📊

The model has been trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset provided by Kaggle, consisting of MRI scans of patients with and without brain tumors. The dataset contains labeled images, enabling the model to learn patterns and features indicative of brain tumors.

## Model Performance ✨

BrainTune has achieved an impressive accuracy of 95% on the evaluation set from the Kaggle dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the model's ability to effectively identify brain tumors from medical imaging data. However, it is important to note that BrainTune is a tool to assist medical professionals and should not replace expert diagnosis.
